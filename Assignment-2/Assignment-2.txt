IT instruction is a conditional instruction. Condition can be same or it can also be logically inverse. Conditional instruction 
inside block forms conditional IT block.
The following instructions are not allowed inside an IT Block
1.IT
2.CBZ and CBNZ
3.CPSIDE and CPSIE
A branch instruction either must be outside the IT block or last instruction of IT block,Care must be taken to avoid the branching
instruction inside an IT block,except when returning from exception hanadler.Bcod instruction can be inside or outside an IT block.
Each instruction inside the IT block must specify a conditional code suffix ,this is the problem with the given code.
 The given code is

area appcode, CODE, READONLY
export __main
ENTRY
__main function
MOV R3, #0x100
MOV R8, #0x200
CMP R8, R3 ; do R8 - R3 & updated N & V flags
ITTTE LT ; or N != V
MOV R3, #0x100
MOV R8, #0x200
MOV R7, #0x200
MOV R6, #0x200
stop B stop ; stop program
endfunc
end
 As it is clear from code that suffix of the  instruction is missing therfore it throws an error.The correct code for IT block is 
written below.
 ITTTE LT ; or N != V
MOVLT R3, #0x100;      // instruction is changed from MOV to MOVLT
MOVLT R8, #0x200;     // instruction is changed from MOV to MOVLT
MOVLT R7, #0x200;    // instruction is changed from MOV to MOVLT
MOVGE R6, #0x200'   // instruction is changed from MOV to MOVLT 
stop B stop ; stop program
